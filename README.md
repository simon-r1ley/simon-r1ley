- 👋 Hi, I’m @simon-r1ley
- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech! I'm currently learning and embarking on a Linux journey, so take it easy on me as I transition from Windows! :-) Learning fast and taking every opportunity to learn more!  
- 🌱 I’m learning K8, AWS, and a little AI engineering and looking into Meshtastic! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help make the world better than how I found it!
